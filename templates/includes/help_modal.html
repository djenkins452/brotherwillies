                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> This is your quick-look dashboard. It shows live games with real-time scores and the top upcoming games where our model thinks the market might be off, so you can jump straight to the most interesting matchups.</li>
                    <li><strong>Live Now</strong> — When games are in progress, they appear at the top with a pulsing LIVE badge and current scores. Scores are updated from ESPN (CBB) and CollegeFootballData.com (CFB) on each data refresh. Tap any live game to see the full analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>What does "Edge" mean?</strong> Edge is the gap between what our model thinks the probability of a team winning is versus what the betting market implies. For example, if the market says Alabama has a 60% chance to win, but our model calculates 68%, the edge is +8%. A bigger positive edge means our model sees more value than the market does.</li>
                    <li><strong>What does "Market %" mean?</strong> This is the implied win probability derived from the current betting odds. Sportsbooks set odds, and those odds can be converted into a percentage. If a team is -200 on the moneyline, that implies roughly a 67% win probability.</li>
                    <li><strong>What does "House %" mean?</strong> This is the percentage our house model calculates as the team's true win probability, based on team ratings, injuries, and home field advantage. The model takes the rating difference between teams, adds a home field adjustment, factors in injury impacts, and converts the result into a probability using a logistic function. It's independent of what the betting market says.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidence badges (HIGH / MED / LOW)</strong> tell you how much data we have behind the calculation. HIGH means odds updated within 2 hours and injury data is available. MED means odds within 12 hours. LOW means data may be stale or incomplete.</li>
                    <li><strong>YOUR TEAM</strong> badge appears on games involving the favorite team you set in Preferences.</li>
                    <li>Log in to see the full Value Board with all games, filters, and your personalized model.</li>

                    <li><strong>Where does this data come from?</strong> Game schedules and scores are pulled from ESPN's public API (CBB) and CollegeFootballData.com (CFB). Betting odds (moneyline, point spread, over/under) come from The Odds API, which aggregates real-time lines from major US sportsbooks. Injury data is sourced from ESPN's injury reports. Our model runs its own calculations on top of this data to produce the probabilities and edge numbers you see. When live data is not available (offseason or demo mode), sample data is shown instead — look for an "Offseason" banner at the top of the page.</li>

                <h4>Value Board</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is the Value Board?</strong> It's a ranked list of upcoming games sorted by how much our model disagrees with the betting market. Games are organized into collapsible timeframe sections so you can focus on what matters most right now.</li>

                    <li><strong>Game Sections</strong> — Games are grouped by when they're played:
                        <br>- <strong>Big Matchups</strong> — Top 5 matchups ranked by combined team rating. These are the marquee games of the week.
                        <br>- <strong>Today's Games</strong> — Games happening today (expanded by default).
                        <br>- <strong>Tomorrow's Games</strong> — Tomorrow's slate.
                        <br>- <strong>This Week</strong> — Remaining games this week.
                        <br>- <strong>Coming Up</strong> — Games beyond this week.
                        <br>Click any section header to expand or collapse it. Your preferences are saved automatically.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Favorite Team Highlight</strong> — Games involving your favorite team show a colored accent bar at the top of the card, using your team's school color. Set your favorite team in Preferences.</li>

                    <li><strong>House Edge</strong> — This is the house model's probability minus the market's implied probability. Example: If the house model says Alabama has a 72% chance to beat Auburn, and the market implies 65%, the house edge is +7.0%. A positive number means the house model thinks the team is undervalued by the market.</li>

                    <li><strong>User Edge</strong> — Same concept, but using YOUR custom model weights instead of the house model. If you've tuned your model (in "My Model") to weight injuries more heavily, your probabilities will differ from the house model, and your edge may be different too.</li>

                    <li><strong>Delta</strong> — The difference between your model and the house model. If your model says 75% and the house says 72%, the delta is +3%. This shows where YOU disagree with the house model. A large delta means your settings are pulling the analysis in a meaningfully different direction.</li>

                    <li><strong>How do the filters work?</strong> Filters let you narrow down which games appear on the board. You set these in Preferences (/profile/preferences/), and they automatically apply here:
                        <br>- <strong>Spread filters</strong> limit games to a specific point spread range
                        <br>- <strong>Odds filters</strong> limit games to a specific moneyline range
                        <br>- <strong>Minimum edge</strong> hides games below your edge threshold
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Favorite team override</strong> — If you've set a favorite team AND enabled "Always include favorite team" in Preferences, that team's games always appear on the board regardless of your filter settings. You'll never miss your team.</li>

                    <li><strong>Confidence (HIGH / MED / LOW)</strong> — This tells you how reliable the data behind the calculation is. HIGH means odds are recent and injury data is complete. MED means some data might be a few hours old. LOW means data may be stale or missing — take those numbers with a grain of salt.</li>

                    <li><strong>Where does this data come from?</strong> The Value Board combines data from multiple sources:
                        <br>- <strong>Game schedules and scores</strong> come from ESPN's public API (for both CFB and CBB). Games are refreshed regularly to capture schedule changes and final scores.
                        <br>- <strong>Betting odds</strong> (moneyline, point spread, over/under totals) come from <strong>The Odds API</strong>, which aggregates real-time lines from major US sportsbooks like DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, and others. Odds are captured as snapshots so you can see how lines move over time.
                        <br>- <strong>Injury data</strong> is sourced from ESPN's injury reports, including player status (out, doubtful, questionable, probable) and estimated impact level.
                        <br>- <strong>Edge and probability numbers</strong> are calculated by our own model — they are NOT taken from any external source. The model uses the raw data above as inputs and produces independent probability estimates.
                        <br>- During the offseason or when live data feeds are disabled, the board shows sample/demo data for illustration purposes.

                <h4>College Football Hub</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> This is your gateway to browse all college football conferences, teams, and upcoming games. Think of it like a schedule page with our model's analysis layered on top.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conferences</strong> — College football teams are grouped into conferences (like the SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, etc.). Tap any conference to see its teams and their upcoming games.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conference page</strong> — Shows all teams in that conference along with their upcoming matchups. Each game card shows the teams, kickoff time, and quick edge numbers so you can spot interesting games at a glance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game cards</strong> — Each card shows two teams, the game date/time, and the house model's edge. Tap any game card to go to the full game detail page with all the analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>What should I look for?</strong> Games with high absolute edge values are where our model disagrees most with the market. Those are the most analytically interesting matchups to dig into.</li>

                    <li><strong>Where does this data come from?</strong> CFB game schedules are pulled from the <strong>CollegeFootballData.com (CFBD) API</strong> during the season, with ESPN's public API providing supplementary schedule and injury data. Betting odds come from <strong>The Odds API</strong>, aggregating lines from major US sportsbooks. During the CFB offseason (roughly February through July), the page shows sample data for demonstration — you'll see an "Offseason" banner when this is the case.</li>
                </ul>

            {% elif help_key == 'cbb_hub' %}
                <h4>College Basketball Hub</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> This is your gateway to browse all college basketball conferences, teams, and upcoming games. It works the same way as the CFB Hub but for basketball.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conferences</strong> — College basketball teams are grouped into conferences (like the SEC, Big Ten, Big East, etc.). Tap any conference to see its teams and their upcoming games.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conference page</strong> — Shows all teams in that conference along with their upcoming matchups. Each game card shows the teams, tip-off time, and quick edge numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game cards</strong> — Each card shows two teams, the game date/time, and the house model's edge. Tap any game card for full analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>What should I look for?</strong> Games with high absolute edge values are where our model disagrees most with the market — those are the most analytically interesting matchups.</li>

                    <li><strong>Where does this data come from?</strong> CBB game schedules are fetched from <strong>ESPN's public API</strong>, which covers all Division I men's college basketball games. Historical game data comes from the <strong>CollegeBasketballData.com (CBBD) API</strong>. Betting odds are sourced from <strong>The Odds API</strong>, which aggregates real-time lines from major US sportsbooks. Injury reports come from ESPN. All edge and probability numbers are calculated by our own model using this data as input.</li>
                </ul>

            {% elif help_key == 'game_detail' %}
                <h4>Game Detail</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> This is the deep-dive analysis for a single game. You'll see side-by-side comparisons of what the market thinks, what our house model thinks, and what your personal model thinks. For completed games, you'll also see the final score and outcome.</li>

                    <li><strong>Game Status and Scores</strong> — Games display their current status:
                        <br>- <strong>No badge</strong> = Scheduled (hasn't started yet)
                        <br>- <strong>LIVE badge</strong> = Currently in progress, with live scores shown next to each team name
                        <br>- <strong>FINAL badge</strong> = Game is complete, final scores displayed
                        <br>Scores are pulled from ESPN (CBB) and CollegeFootballData.com (CFB) during each data refresh cycle. The probability analysis remains visible for completed games so you can compare what the model predicted to what actually happened.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Market Probability</strong> — The win percentage implied by the current betting odds. This is what sportsbooks and the collective betting market believe. For example, if Alabama is -300 on the moneyline, the market implies roughly a 75% chance of winning.</li>

                    <li><strong>House Model Probability</strong> — What our model calculates as the actual win probability based on team ratings, home field advantage, and injuries. The model uses a logistic function: it takes the rating difference between the two teams, adds a home field adjustment (3.0 points for CFB, 3.5 for CBB), applies injury impact adjustments, and converts the combined score into a probability. This is an independent calculation — it doesn't look at the market odds.</li>

                    <li><strong>Your Model Probability</strong> — The same calculation but using YOUR custom weight settings from the "My Model" page. If you've cranked up the injury weight, games with key injuries will shift more in your model than in the house model.</li>

                    <li><strong>Edge</strong> — The difference between a model's probability and the market's probability. Example: If the house model says 72% and the market says 65%, the house edge is +7.0%. Positive edge means the model thinks the team is undervalued by the market. Delta shows the gap between your model and the house model.</li>

                    <li><strong>Line movement</strong> — The arrows (▲ ▼) show how the odds have changed since they were first posted. If the spread moves from -3.5 to -7, that's significant movement, usually meaning sharp money or new information has come in. Movement toward a team means the market is becoming more confident in that team.</li>

                    <li><strong>Injury impacts</strong> — Key player injuries are listed with their estimated impact on the game (HIGH / MED / LOW). A starting quarterback being out (HIGH impact = 6% shift) has a much larger effect than a reserve player (LOW impact = 1% shift). These injuries are factored directly into the model's probability calculation.</li>

                    <li><strong>Confidence</strong> — Reflects data quality behind the calculation:
                        <br>- <strong>HIGH</strong> = Odds updated within 2 hours AND injury data available
                        <br>- <strong>MED</strong> = Odds updated within 12 hours
                        <br>- <strong>LOW</strong> = Odds older than 12 hours or no odds at all
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Where does this data come from?</strong>
                        <br>- <strong>Scores</strong> come from ESPN (CBB) or CFBD (CFB), updated on each data refresh cycle.
                        <br>- <strong>Odds and line movement</strong> come from <strong>The Odds API</strong>, which pulls real-time lines from major US sportsbooks (DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, and others). We capture multiple snapshots over time, which is how we show line movement.
                        <br>- <strong>Injury reports</strong> are sourced from <strong>ESPN</strong>, including player status and our estimate of the injury's impact on the game outcome.
                        <br>- <strong>All probabilities and edges</strong> are calculated by our model — they are independent estimates, not copied from any sportsbook or external source.

                    <li><strong>AI Insight</strong> — Tap the "AI Insight" button to get a generated explanation of why the house model and market disagree (or agree) on this game. The AI uses ONLY the data already shown on this page — team ratings, injuries, odds, and model probabilities. It does not invent facts or speculate.
                        <br>- The AI's tone is controlled by your <strong>AI Persona</strong> setting in Preferences (Analyst, New York Bookie, Southern Commentator, or Ex-Player). Different personas say the same facts in different voices.
                        <br>- The response is generated on demand using OpenAI's API. It is not cached or stored as fact.

            {% elif help_key == 'my_model' %}
                <h4>My Model</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> This is where you customize your own probability model. The house model uses default weights for various factors — here you can adjust those weights to reflect your own analysis philosophy. Your changes affect the "User" probabilities and edges throughout the site.</li>

                    <li><strong>How weights work:</strong> Each weight is a multiplier (default 1.0). Setting a weight higher than 1.0 means that factor matters MORE in your model. Setting it lower than 1.0 means it matters LESS. Setting it to 0 removes that factor entirely.</li>

                    <li><strong>Rating Weight (default: 1.0)</strong> — Controls how much overall team strength matters. Team ratings measure how good a team is historically and this season. Example: If you think the pre-season rankings and overall records are very predictive, increase this. If you think they're overrated and want to rely more on other factors, decrease it.</li>

                    <li><strong>Home Field Advantage Weight (default: 1.0)</strong> — Controls how much playing at home matters. College football has notoriously strong home field advantages (think Death Valley at LSU or The Swamp at Florida). Example: Set this to 1.5 if you think home field is undervalued, or 0.5 if you think it matters less than conventional wisdom suggests.</li>

                    <li><strong>Injury Weight (default: 1.0)</strong> — Controls how much player injuries affect probabilities. Example: If Alabama's starting QB is out, the house model might shift the probability by 5%. Setting your injury weight to 2.0 would roughly double that shift in your model. Increase this if you believe injuries are more impactful than the default model assumes.</li>

                    <li><strong>Recent Form Weight (default: 1.0)</strong> — Controls emphasis on recent games vs. season-long performance. Example: If a team started 1-3 but has won 5 in a row, a high recent form weight will favor their current hot streak. A low weight will still see that rocky start. Useful for identifying teams that are improving or collapsing late in the season.</li>

                    <li><strong>Conference Weight (default: 1.0)</strong> — Controls the conference strength adjustment. Not all conferences are equal — SEC teams playing each other may both be strong, while a mid-major might have an inflated record from a weaker schedule. Example: Increase this if you think conference strength is very predictive of cross-conference results.</li>

                    <li><strong>Reset to Defaults</strong> — Sets all weights back to 1.0 (matching the house model). Your model will then produce identical results to the house model.</li>

                    <li><strong>Presets</strong> — Once you find weight settings you like, save them as a preset so you can switch between different strategies. Access presets from the Presets page.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>My Statistics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> This tracks your personal activity on the site — which games you've analyzed, how your model compares to the house model, and patterns in your usage. It's your analytics journal.</li>

                    <li><strong>Games Analyzed</strong> — The number of unique game detail pages you've viewed. Each time you view a game, it's recorded so you can track your analysis activity over time.</li>

                    <li><strong>Favorite Team Games</strong> — How many of the games you've analyzed involved your favorite team. If you set Alabama as your favorite, this counts how many Alabama games you've dug into.</li>

                    <li><strong>Average House Edge</strong> — The average edge across all games you've analyzed. If this number is high, it means you tend to look at games where the house model sees a lot of market disagreement — you're drawn to the more interesting matchups.</li>

                    <li><strong>Average User Edge</strong> — Same as above but for your personal model. Comparing this to the house edge shows whether your custom weights tend to find more or less value than the house model.</li>

                    <li><strong>Agreement Rate</strong> — How often your model and the house model agree on which side has positive edge. A high agreement rate means your weights are producing similar conclusions to the house model. A low rate means your model is identifying different opportunities — which isn't necessarily bad, it just means you're taking a contrarian approach.</li>

                    <li><strong>Confidence Distribution</strong> — Shows the breakdown of HIGH, MED, and LOW confidence games you've analyzed. If most of your analysis is on LOW confidence games, you might want to be extra cautious with those conclusions.</li>

                    <li><strong>Time periods</strong> — Use the 7-day, 30-day, and Season filters to view your activity over different windows.</li>

                    <li><strong>Important:</strong> Past analysis patterns do not predict future outcomes. These stats track your behavior, not your success.</li>
                </ul>

            {% elif help_key == 'performance' %}
                <h4>Model Performance</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> This is a report card for the house model's predictions on games that have already been completed. Every metric here is computed from real results — no hypotheticals.</li>

                    <li><strong>Where do these numbers come from?</strong> Before each game (within 24 hours of kickoff/tipoff), the system automatically captures a snapshot of the house model's prediction: the market probability, the house model's probability, and the data confidence level. After the game ends and scores are recorded, the system resolves the outcome (which team actually won) and captures the closing line (the last market odds before the game started). All the metrics on this page are computed from these snapshots.</li>

                    <li><strong>Overall Metrics</strong>
                        <br>- <strong>Accuracy</strong> — The percentage of games where the model correctly predicted which team would win. If the model said Team A had a 65% chance and Team A won, that's a correct prediction. A good model won't be right every time — a team with a 70% chance still loses 3 out of 10 games.
                        <br>- <strong>Brier Score</strong> — Measures how close predicted probabilities were to reality. Scale: 0 (perfect) to 1 (worst). Below 0.15 is excellent, 0.20 is solid, above 0.30 needs work. The Brier score rewards confidence when correct and penalizes confidence when wrong — a model that says 80-20 and is right scores much better than one that says 51-49 and is right.
                        <br>- <strong>Games</strong> — Total completed games with resolved outcomes. More games = more reliable metrics. Early in a season, take small sample sizes with a grain of salt.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>By Sport</strong> — Accuracy and Brier score broken out separately for College Football and College Basketball. The model uses slightly different parameters for each sport (e.g., CFB home field advantage is 3.0 points, CBB is 3.5), so their performance can differ. This lets you see which sport the model handles better.</li>

                    <li><strong>Recent Trends</strong> — Performance over the last 7 days and 30 days. If accuracy is trending up, the model is improving with more data. If it's trending down, something may have shifted in the sport that the model hasn't adjusted to. Comparing short-term to long-term performance helps spot these patterns.</li>

                    <li><strong>Closing Line Value (CLV)</strong>
                        <br>- <strong>What it measures:</strong> CLV tracks whether the market moved toward the model's prediction between when the snapshot was captured and game time. If the model said a team was undervalued at 60% and the closing line moved to 63%, that's positive CLV — the market agreed with the model by kickoff.
                        <br>- <strong>Avg CLV</strong> — The average amount the market moved toward the model's position, shown as a percentage. Positive = the model was ahead of the market. Negative = the market moved away.
                        <br>- <strong>Positive CLV Rate</strong> — What percentage of games had the market move in the model's direction. Above 50% is encouraging.
                        <br>- <strong>Why it matters:</strong> In sports analytics, consistently beating the closing line is considered one of the strongest signals that a model identifies real value, because the closing line is the most efficient point in the market.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Calibration</strong> — This table answers: "When the model predicts 70%, does the favored team actually win about 70% of the time?" Games are bucketed by prediction range (50-60%, 60-70%, etc.) and the actual win rate is compared to the average prediction. If predicted and actual rates are close, the model is well-calibrated. Large differences (shown in red) indicate the model is over- or under-confident in that range.</li>

                    <li><strong>Recent Results</strong> — The last 50 resolved games showing the market probability at snapshot time, the house model's probability, the closing line (if available), and the actual outcome. Each result is tagged with sport (CFB/CBB), model version, and data confidence level.</li>

                    <li><strong>Important:</strong> These are model quality indicators for informational purposes. They measure analytical accuracy, not financial outcomes. Past model performance does not predict future results.</li>

                <h4>Parlay Analytics</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is a parlay?</strong> A parlay combines multiple individual picks ("legs") into one group. For a parlay to succeed, every single leg must be correct. This makes parlays exciting but much harder to get right — the more legs you add, the lower the combined probability.</li>

                    <li><strong>What does this page do?</strong> It lets you build hypothetical parlays and see the combined probability our model assigns. This is an analysis tool — it helps you understand the true mathematical likelihood of a parlay hitting based on our model's probabilities.</li>

                    <li><strong>How combined probability works:</strong> If Leg 1 has a 70% chance and Leg 2 has a 60% chance, the combined probability is 0.70 x 0.60 = 42%. Add a third leg at 65% and it drops to 27%. This is why parlays are hard — even strong individual picks combine into a relatively low overall probability.</li>

                    <li><strong>Correlation Risk</strong> — This flags when two or more legs in your parlay might be connected. Example: If you have Alabama to win AND Alabama's opponent to score under 20 points, those outcomes are correlated — if Alabama wins big, the opponent probably didn't score much. Our tool detects same-game correlations and applies a conservative adjustment (10% haircut) to the probability estimate, because correlated outcomes shouldn't be multiplied as if they're independent.</li>

                    <li><strong>Why the 10% haircut?</strong> When two events are correlated, simply multiplying their probabilities overstates the combined probability. The 10% reduction is a conservative approximation to account for this. In reality, the correlation effect varies by situation, but this gives you a more realistic estimate than ignoring it.</li>

                    <li><strong>Model Probability vs. Market Odds:</strong> The model probability is what our model thinks the parlay's true chance is. Compare this to the implied probability from market odds to see if there's an analytical edge. A bigger gap between model and market suggests the parlay is more analytically interesting.</li>

                    <li><strong>Important:</strong> This is an analytics and modeling tool for educational purposes. It is not betting advice. Always assess risk independently.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> Golf analytics for PGA Tour events. When active tournaments are available, you'll see tournament fields, golfer odds, and implied probabilities.</li>

                    <li><strong>Where does this data come from?</strong> Tournament schedules and golfer fields are pulled from <strong>ESPN's public PGA API</strong>. Outright winner odds come from <strong>The Odds API</strong>, covering major tournaments (The Masters, PGA Championship, The Open Championship, and the U.S. Open). Odds are shown as American moneyline with implied probabilities calculated from those lines.</li>

                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> Golf analytics are still being expanded. Full tournament modeling, course fit metrics, and historical performance data are coming soon.</li>

                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> This is your personal information page where you can set your name, email, and profile picture. It's also where you access all your personalization features.</li>

                </ul>

            {% elif help_key == 'preferences' %}
                <h4>Preferences</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this page?</strong> This is where you personalize how Brother Willies works for you. Your preferences control which games show up on the Value Board and how the site highlights information relevant to you.</li>

                    <li><strong>Favorite Conference</strong> — Pick the conference you follow most (SEC, Big Ten, etc.). This is used to highlight relevant games and prioritize your conference in listings.</li>

                    <li><strong>Favorite Team</strong> — Pick your team. For example, if you select Alabama, games involving Alabama will be tagged with a "YOUR TEAM" badge throughout the site, making them easy to spot.</li>

                    <li><strong>Always Include Favorite Team</strong> — When checked, your favorite team's games will ALWAYS appear on the Value Board, even if they don't meet your filter criteria. Example: If you set a minimum edge of 5% but Alabama's next game only has a 2% edge, it would normally be filtered out. With this box checked, Alabama's game still shows up. Uncheck it if you only want to see games that pass all your filters, regardless of team.</li>

                    <li><strong>Preference Spread Min / Max</strong> — These filter the Value Board by point spread. The point spread is how many points one team is favored by. Example with Alabama as your team:
                        <br>- Alabama -14.5 vs. Vanderbilt means Alabama is favored by 14.5 points
                        <br>- If you set Spread Min = 3 and Spread Max = 10, you'd only see games where the spread is between 3 and 10 points
                        <br>- This filters out blowout games (huge spreads) and near-toss-ups (tiny spreads)
                        <br>- Leave blank to see all games regardless of spread
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Preference Odds Min / Max</strong> — These filter by moneyline odds. Moneyline odds represent which team is favored and by how much:
                        <br>- Negative odds (like -200) mean the team is favored. -200 means you'd risk $200 to profit $100
                        <br>- Positive odds (like +150) mean the team is the underdog. +150 means you'd risk $100 to profit $150
                        <br>- Example: If you set Odds Min = -300 and Odds Max = +300, you'd filter out extreme favorites and extreme underdogs
                        <br>- Leave blank to see all games regardless of odds
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Preference Minimum Edge</strong> — This sets the minimum edge required for a game to appear on the Value Board. Edge = model probability minus market probability.
                        <br>- Example: If you set this to 3.0, only games where the model sees at least a 3% edge will show up
                        <br>- Set to 0 to see all games
                        <br>- Set to 5.0 or higher to only see games with significant model-vs-market disagreement
                        <br>- A reasonable starting point is 2.0-3.0 — this shows games where the model meaningfully disagrees with the market without being too restrictive
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Sample setup for an Alabama fan:</strong>
                        <br>- Favorite Conference: SEC
                        <br>- Favorite Team: Alabama
                        <br>- Always Include Favorite Team: checked
                        <br>- Spread Min: 1.0 (skip pick'em games)
                        <br>- Spread Max: 20.0 (skip extreme blowouts)
                        <br>- Odds Min: -400 (skip extreme favorites)
                        <br>- Odds Max: 300 (skip extreme underdogs)
                        <br>- Minimum Edge: 2.0 (show games with at least 2% model edge)
                        <br>This would give you a focused Value Board of competitive games where the model sees meaningful disagreement with the market, while always including Alabama's games.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>What is this?</strong> Brother Willies Predictions is a sports analytics platform for college football and basketball. We run mathematical models that estimate win probabilities for upcoming games and compare them against the betting market's implied probabilities.</li>

                    <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Our house model looks at team ratings, home field advantage, injuries, recent form, and conference strength to calculate each team's win probability. We compare that to what the betting market says. When our model disagrees with the market, that shows up as "edge" — the bigger the edge, the more the model disagrees.</li>

                    <li><strong>Your custom model:</strong> You can create your own model by adjusting the weights of each factor. Maybe you think injuries matter more than the default model assumes, or home field advantage is overrated. Your custom weights generate your own probabilities that you can compare against both the market and the house model.</li>
